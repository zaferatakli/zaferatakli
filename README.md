## 👋 Hi, I’m Zafer Atakli

🎓 I hold a degree in **Web Design and Coding** from Anadolu University and bring 20+ years of hands-on technical experience across 
the **Industrial Electronics, Finance, Healthcare, and Education** sectors. Throughout my career, 
I’ve worked on automation systems, PLC programming, and BMS infrastructure—gaining a strong foundation in how hardware and software work together in real-world environments.

I’ve developed practical expertise across the entire software testing lifecycle, contributing to test planning, execution, automation, and reporting—using both black-box and white-box methods.
