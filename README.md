## 👋 Hi, I’m Zafer Atakli

🎓 I graduated from **Eskişehir Anadolu University** with a degree in Web Design and Coding. With a long-standing passion for technology and software, I have gained hands-on experience in multiple sectors including **Industrial Electronics, Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, Education, and Finance**.

💡 My background includes setting up, monitoring, testing, and commissioning automation systems. Through working on **PLC programming** and **BMS system design**, I developed a deep understanding of how hardware and software work together in real-world environments.

🔧 My transition into the **Software Testing** field was driven by my growing interest in system reliability and quality assurance. I’m currently attending a **QA Bootcamp**, where I lead a **team of 8 interns** in weekly Agile-based projects.

### 👨‍💻 Current Activities
- 🌱 Building test automation frameworks using **Java, JUnit, TestNG, and Cucumber**  
- 🚀 Leading Agile ceremonies: **Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, and Sprint Reviews, Retro**  
- 📝 Creating and managing **User Stories and Tasks** in **JIRA**  
- 🔄 Managing repositories, reviewing **Pull Requests**, and collaborating via **GitHub**  
- 🧪 Designing and executing **manual and automation test cases**  
- 👥 Developing leadership and team coordination skills in a real-world project setting  
- 💬 Working with Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, using JUnit and TestNG as test frameworks, and implementing Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber 
- 🔍 Continuously improving previous projects by refactoring and enhancing code
- 💻 Database Testing using **MySQL** and **JDBC**

### 🛠️ Upcoming Focus Areas
- API Testing with **Postman** and **Rest Assured**    
- CI/CD & Regression Testing using **Jenkins**  
- Mobile Testing with **Appium**  
- 📚 Preparing for the **ISTQB Foundation Level Certification**

🤝 I’m open to collaborating with **QA Engineers, Automation Testers, Developers, and Mentors** in the field.  
📈 Motivated by learning, improving, and contributing to software quality at every stage of development.
