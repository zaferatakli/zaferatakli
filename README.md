## 👋 Hello, I'm Zafer Atakli

🎓 I have a professional background rooted in industrial automation, having worked for many years in Turkey with SCADA, BMS, and PMS systems. I was actively involved in Siemens and Honeywell-based projects—testing systems on-site and developing user interfaces. This experience gave me a strong foundation in analytical thinking, attention to detail, and structured problem-solving.

In 2022, I made a bold move to Australia, where I improved my English and transitioned into the world of software testing. I completed an intensive 7-month SDET program, and since then, I’ve been actively engaged in both manual and automated testing. I now work with tools such as Java, Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, Postman, Appium, and Jenkins, and I currently lead a QA internship project with a team of 10 members.

### 🔁 From System Technician to QA Engineer

My transition into **Software Testing** was a natural evolution of my passion for reliability and precision. After completing an intensive, hands-on **QA Bootcamp**, I led an Agile team of 8 QA interns, designed robust test frameworks, and tested real-world applications end-to-end.

I'm now equipped with strong practical experience across the **entire software testing lifecycle**, including test planning, execution, automation, reporting, and debugging—using both black-box and white-box techniques.
